# ice — lessons

Method lessons from building the ICE generator. Each one cost time; the run directories under
`runs/2026-10-09-ice-*` hold the scripts that measured them.

1. **Score a rollout only where the real data was usable.** Real ICE has ~14% excluded intervals
   (pod changes, disruptions, compression lows) that cut episodes short; a rollout has none. Scored
   unmasked, v1 looked like it made meals 0.8 h too long and 8 g-eq too large; masked like the real
   held-out weeks it is +0.23 h and −0.9 g-eq, at the floor. The same mixing made the mean-ICE bias
   look twice its size (real ICE over all intervals is 68.5 mg/dL/h, over clean ones 66.4). Mask the
   rollout with the real record's `clean` at the same CGM timestamps before any comparison
   (`rollout.py`, `rescore.py`).

2. **5-min ICE is positively autocorrelated (lag-1 ≈ +0.5 to +0.6), not negatively.** CGM readings
   are already smoothed by the sensor, so differencing does not produce the alternating noise
   signature a white-noise sensor would. Measure the noise structure; don't derive it.

3. **The BG input is what produces rescue eating.** Removing BG and insulin inputs costs only
   0.012 nats/step one step ahead, but in closed loop the response to BG < 70 collapses (91 vs a real
   114 mg/dL/h) and lows rise to replay levels (t<54 1.73% vs 0.08% with the inputs, 0.16% field).
   One-step likelihood does not measure what matters for lows.

4. **v1 is calibrated one step ahead** (predicted mean ICE 66.1 vs actual 65.1 on held-out weeks).
   Parallel scheduled sampling (fine-tuned from v1, p ≤ 0.5, 2 passes) did not help: the free-run
   ICE level drifted further up (+6.9 vs +3.9 mg/dL/h) and most statistics got worse.

5. **Meal phases: test against a same-clock null.** A peak detector on smoothed excess ICE finds
   2+ "phases" in 66% of no-meal windows at low prominence. Calibrated so the null shows 11%, 22–26%
   of isolated announced meals show a second rise — real, in a minority, not size-dependent.

6. **The frozen-ICE replay over-produces lows under stock Loop** (t<54 1.24% vs field 0.16%, 24
   pilot donors), and runs ~9 mg/dL above the field on mean BG with real ICE — so about half of the
   generator's closed-loop mean-BG gap is the controller not matching each donor's deployed config.
